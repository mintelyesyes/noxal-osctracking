**Noxal Tracking**

_A simple but managable tracking solution_
(This project is highly based off of AprilTag-Trackers which utilizes this better but is PCVR only.)




In short, Noxal Tracking is a proof-of-concept open-source beta tracking solution that uses a camera to track specific colors and output tracker potitions out of them.


The current features are limited, other than the fact you can adjust the positions of the trackers.

I am planning to add depth support using 2 cameras, and possibly rotation estimation.

Usually the trackers spawn far away in OSC. You are meant to use "Auto-recenter OSC trackers" In the Small-scale VRChat settings to put them in the correct area.

If there are any problems or requests to help with or contribute to this program, either post a issue/request in the **Issues** tab or contact me through Gmail. (dem872627@gmail.com)
